            <p>Garrett Pillsbury has been providing plumbing and heating services to the York county community since 1959. That’s over 55 years of dependable service.</p>
            <p>A year ago, we extended our services to include heating oil and propane delivery, giving our customers the fullest offering of plumbing, heating, and air conditioning services around. Since then our heating oil and propane trucks have been busy making deliveries all over town.</p>
            <p>We're a locally owned and operated company, which means 100% of the business you do with us is reinvested back into the community. And like any trusted neighbor, we'll always be there to make sure you have what you need.</p>
