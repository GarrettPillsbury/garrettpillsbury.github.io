            <h1>Reduce Oil Dependency With a Split System</h1>
            <p>Reducing your carbon footprint doesn't just make you feel all warm inside &ndash; it can also heat your home at a fraction of the cost of traditional heating systems. With a split heating and cooling system, homeowners typically cut down their dependence on oil and propane by 50%, in turn mitigating the risk of volatile oil prices that keep homeowners on edge every winter.</p>
            <p>The way split systems work is simple. An outside compressor extracts air uses electricity to pump it through piping to inside units that distribute the air accordingly. When your home is too cold it pumps in warm air, and when it's too hot it pumps in cool air. All you have to do is set the temperature using your remote and the system does the rest.</p>
            <p>Despite it's many benefits, there are a few downsides to having a split heating and cooling system in your home, and most have to do with how it looks. Piping is visible on outside of the home, as is a wall unit on the inside. There are ways to conceal the visible elements for the system, some more low tech than others. Alternative duct work is one way to do it, though it's only recommended for new homes as it can be a costly for existing homes.</p>
            <p>If you're considering installing a split heating and cooling system in your home, you'll need to figure out if you want to heat and cool your entire home with it or just a few rooms. But even using it in one room is worth the savings and comfort it provides.</p>
